**Tagline:** *Internet freedom for everyone — resilient, private, and open.*

NetGoVPN is a free, open-source Android client engineered to provide reliable, privacy-respecting, and censorship-resistant network connectivity for users in high-restriction environments. It helps people reach essential information safely — from education to communication with loved ones.

## 🚩 Mission

To preserve access to open information and support individuals experiencing network censorship and surveillance.  
We design with **user safety first**, prioritizing anonymity, resilience, and ease of use.

---

## 🛡️ Censorship-Resistant Capabilities

* Automated fallback and multi-protocol switching
* Obfuscation and traffic camouflage (high-level disclosures only to protect users)
* Dynamic server rotation & failover
* Minimal fingerprintable behavior

> We intentionally avoid publishing operational details that may help adversaries.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Lightweight, stable client for Android API 23+
* Dynamic routing & connection-quality monitoring
* Low detection surface & conservative telemetry
* Modular architecture for future transports
* UX designed for non-technical users in risky environments

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

* **No logs** of user identity or traffic content
* Minimal, privacy-respecting aggregated telemetry
* Responsible disclosure program with PGP
* Security-sensitive infrastructure kept private

See: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

## 🧭 Threat Model (summary)

**Primary threats:** DPI blocking, network surveillance, accidental exposure during connection  
Limitations: not a replacement for OPSEC or tools designed for anonymity from state-level actors
